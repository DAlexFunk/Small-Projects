## Description

* A simple Tic Tac Toe game I made to develop Python skills
* The code can be vastly improved, however, I felt that keeping the code how it is the best move to preserve where I was at the time
* Helped me learn to use other modules in Python

## How to Use

* Run the tictactoe.py file with the other files
* The game will appear in the console with instructions from there
* The opponent is random
