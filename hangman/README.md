# Hangman

By Alex Funk  
April 2023

## Description

* Basic hangman game I made when I first learned Python to get used to the language.
* The code is very messy because I knew less at that point.
* I learned a lot from this project, mainly how to import other Python files I create.
* I would have gone back to make the code neater, like removing the config.py file, for example. However, I thought it was best to keep this project in its original form.

## How to use

* Load the hangman.py file and run it.
* The user can either choose to be the guesser or come up with the word for the computer to guess.
* There is no algorithm behind the computer's guesses and they are completely random.

## Credits

* My high school Python professor for teaching me Python and helping me realize that this is what I want to do.
